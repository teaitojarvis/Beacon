# Governance

Beacon is a governance layer for personal AI agents. It prioritizes explicit consent, human control, and observability.

## Project philosophy

- Beacon is **not** a general-purpose assistant.
- It is a governance layer that constrains how agents act.
- Local-first and inspectable defaults are preferred.

## Breaking change policy

Any move toward autonomy, collective governance, or social optimization is a breaking change and requires explicit community review.

## Maintainer model

- Maintainers review changes for alignment with the project philosophy.
- Changes that affect approvals, capabilities, or logging require careful review.
- Security-related decisions prioritize minimizing user risk.

## Decision process

- Start with discussion in issues.
- Aim for consensus among maintainers.
- When consensus is not possible, maintainers may decide with a clear rationale.
