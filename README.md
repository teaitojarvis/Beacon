Beacon is a governance layer for personal AI agents, focused on human sovereignty, explicit consent, and radical observability.

## Project status

Beacon is in pre-alpha. The public scope is a minimal, auditable governance core.

## Quick start (coming soon)

Setup instructions will arrive alongside the first runnable prototype.

## Core principles

- **Human sovereignty**: the human remains the sole decision-maker.
- **Explicit consent**: no implicit or irreversible delegation.
- **Radical observability**: what cannot be inspected must not be automated.
- **Local-first**: data stays on the user’s machine by default.

## What Beacon is

Beacon sits between a human and one or more AI agents to govern how actions are approved, executed, and logged. It provides:

- approval pipelines with human-in-the-loop (HITL) controls
- scoped permissions and sandboxed execution
- structured evidence of actions taken
- transparent records of tools, models, and policies

Beacon does not act. It governs how agents are allowed to act.

## Beacon is not...

Beacon is **not**:

- a general-purpose AI assistant
- an autonomous decision-maker
- a social optimization platform
- an AGI or autonomy experiment

Any evolution toward these directions is considered a breaking change.
