# Beacon

**Beacon** is an open-source governance layer for personal AI agents.

It is not an assistant.
It is not an autonomous system.
It is not a platform.

Beacon exists to ensure that powerful AI agents remain:
- **bounded**
- **observable**
- **revocable**
- **under explicit human control**

---

## What Beacon Is

Beacon is a **sovereign guardian layer** that sits between a human and one or more AI agents.

It provides:
- explicit consent and approval pipelines (HITL)
- sandboxed execution
- structured evidence of actions taken
- transparency over tools, models, and biases
- local-first observability by default

Beacon does not act.
It **governs how agents are allowed to act**.

---

## What Beacon Is Not

Beacon is **not**:
- a general-purpose AI assistant
- an autonomous decision-maker
- a collective governance system
- a social optimization tool
- an AGI experiment

Any evolution toward these directions is considered a breaking change.

## Core Principles

- **Human sovereignty**  
  The human remains the sole decision-maker.

- **Explicit delegation**  
  No implicit, persistent, or irreversible action.

- **Supervised agentivity**  
  Agents may propose, never impose.

- **Radical observability**  
  What cannot be inspected must not be automated.

- **Transparency over comfort**  
  Closed tools are allowed, never invisible.

---

## Architecture Overview

Beacon is built around a minimal, auditable core:
- policy and approval gates
- scoped permissions
- sandboxed execution
- structured action logs and evidence packs

Protective mechanisms are implemented through dedicated modules,
such as **Beacon Aegis** (policy enforcement and consent control).

---

## Philosophy

Beacon treats AI as a **power tool**, not as a partner or authority.

It is healthier to build **personal, revocable, inspectable tools**
than to delegate agency to opaque systems “for the greater good”.

Beacon is a companion framework — not a destiny.

---

## Status

Beacon is under active development.
The public version focuses on governance primitives, not on personal data or private memories.
